## Mission Ready, Pet.co.nz Project

Redesign of [Pet.co.nz](https://www.pet.co.nz) website. This was a week long project during my time with Mission Ready and was completed in collaboration with 2 UX designers, I only did the programming portion of the project. The entire MVP was not implemented, this is only the frontpage and products display page of the redesign.

This web application uses React and is containerized with Docker. The backend uses Express.js and Mongoose to communicate with the MongoDB database.
